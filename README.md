# Introduction
We have developed an application that uses Matlab and Reaper to interact through hand gestures. Reaper is audio editing software. Using a gesture recognition system developed in a previous research, we have created an application that allows you to control audio tracks through hand gestures using Myo or GForce Armband.

# OSC Matlab
In Reaper and Matlab, the same IP address and port number parameters must be configured. GitHub Repository

# Gestures Info
The gestures to be performed are mapped to actions in Reaper accordingly the following image GitHub Repository
